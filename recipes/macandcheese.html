        <h1>Southern Fried Mac and Cheese</h1>
        <p>Easy to make authentic southern mac and cheese.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 pounds Cheddar cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>5 eggs, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Layer some of the macaroni in a 5-quart baking dish; top with a layer of Cheddar cheese. Continue layering macaroni and Cheddar cheese into the dish, ending with a Cheddar cheese layer.</li>
            <li>Beat milk, eggs, and mustard together in a bowl; pour over macaroni mixture, ensuring milk mixture gets to all of the macaroni.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and just before cheese around the sides gets crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
